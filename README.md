# IoT-Device-Fingerprinting-and-Authentication-Using-Behavioral-Biometrics
In an IoT network, devices often exhibit unique behavior based on how they communicate with the network (e.g., packet transmission rate, message frequency, and data request patterns). This project uses these unique behavioral characteristics to create device fingerprints for authentication,
